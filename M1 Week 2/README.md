# Task : Number Analysis App
Description: 
## Write a Dart program that performs analysis on a list of numbers. The program should include the following functionalities:

### Find the maximum number in the list.
### Find the minimum number in the list.
### Calculate the sum of all numbers in the list.
### Calculate the average of all numbers in the list.

### You can hardcode the list of numbers directly in your program.
### Example: final numbers = [1,8,3,3,4,45,5,69,10,39,91,10]

## Requirements:
### Create a function named findMaximum that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum number in the list.
### Create a function named findMinimum that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the minimum number in the list.
### Create a function named calculateSum that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all numbers in the list.
### Create a function named calculateAverage that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of all numbers in the list.
### Use control statements (loops, conditionals) to implement the required functionalities.
### Test your functions by calling them with a sample list of numbers and printing the results.

## Task Verification: 
### Create a Repository: Create a repository named 'gdsc_study_session_g_' if you haven't already.
### Create a Folder: Inside the repository, create a folder named ‘Dart-Tasks’.
### Project Naming: Create your project inside the ‘Dart-Tasks’ folder and name it based on the task number. Since this task is the second one, name the project folder as ‘task-2’.
### Submission: Once the task is completed, attach the GitHub link to the progress sheet.
